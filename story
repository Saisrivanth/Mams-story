once upon a time there lived a lion which was trappd in a net and it was very hungry
then no one turned up to help it becaue every other animal thought it was cruel and 
the came forward to help just by thinking it can become lion friend so that it will 
not eat it at any time no matter what...

and now imagine how much happy the lion could be as no other animal came forward 
even though there were many animals wh could have made some time to help the monkey
for example a rat it could have used his shrp teeth to cut the lions trappd

the elephant which powerfull and can cut the b=net but not came front...

now lion and the monkey became friends

now i dont know what else to continue the story because any how monkey helped lion and both are happy

END OF THE STORY BYE! BYE!
